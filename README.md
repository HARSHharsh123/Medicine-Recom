# Disease Prediction and Advisory System

This project is a web application built using Flask for predicting diseases based on user-input symptoms and providing comprehensive advisory information akin to a doctor's consultation.

## Features
1. Symptom Prediction: Users can input their symptoms, and the system predicts the most likely disease using a pre-trained machine learning model.
   
2. Comprehensive Advisory: Upon predicting the disease, the system provides detailed information including disease description, precautions, recommended medications, workout plans, and dietary advice.
   
3. Interactive Interface: The web application provides an interactive interface for users to input symptoms and receive personalized advisory information.
   
## Technologies Used
1. Flask: Used for building the web application backend.
   
2. Pandas and NumPy: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.
   
3. LightGBM: Employed for the machine learning model for disease prediction.
   
4. HTML/CSS: Used for frontend development and styling.
   
## Usage
To run the application locally:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application using python app.py.
Access the application through a web browser at http://localhost:5000.
