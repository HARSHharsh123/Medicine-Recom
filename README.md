## Medicine Recommendation System By HARSH SHUKLA



## Introduction
I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my latest project: A Medicine Recommendation System (MediAssist Pro) ! ðŸŽ‰
This system functions just like having a personal doctor at your fingertips. By inputting your symptoms, it predicts potential disease, provides detailed descriptions about disease, suggests precautions, recommends medications, and even offers workout and diet advice tailored to your condition.

To power this innovative system, I utilized the Lightning Fast and Efficient LightGBM machine learning algorithm. Coupled with Flask for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend (with a little help from their documentation ðŸ˜‰), the result is a seamless and user-friendly experience.
